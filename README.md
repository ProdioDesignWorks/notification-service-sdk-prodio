# Usage

  

  

Sdk module provides a easy and fast way to build notifications in the product.Examples like New Member added to a team, Someone messaged you, one of your friends liked your post, etc are events. Keeping event-driven architecture in mind this service works or reacts to events, which integration with others services easier.
